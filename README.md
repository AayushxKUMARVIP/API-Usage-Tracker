## Note :- 
This is not a good usage to send the data to files to files. Rather than this, We can do a thing is make one file, In that track the user interaction time. Which will be uploaded to a new branch beside this, Named `Web Tracker`.

I had made this because I had to server a Data on my website by their user's visit count.
e.g. On following interactions, 
1. <b>Show only some details.</b>
2. <b>Show my Friends.</b>
3. <b>Show my Projects.</b>
4. <b>Finally, Show details which are likely to be same or similar to be personal.</b>
